- Run [AngelScript](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/) easily with a simple runner built with [OpenSiv3D](https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D).

  - You can run the script by pressing `F5` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `Run AngelScript`.

  - ScriptRunner supports hot reloading, which means that changes to the script are reflected dynamically, even after start-up.

- A button to automatically add 'as.predefined' and a button to insert a template is available.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
